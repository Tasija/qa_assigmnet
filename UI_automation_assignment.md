Please go to https://demo.realworld.io/#/ and review the “Popular Tags” feature.

Popular tags are tags that appear for the most posts in the feed. Clicking on tag should open the channel for this specific tag in a new tab next to the general feed.

Bonus - assume a basic DB schema and write a query to test the actual tags.
